- 👋 Hi, I’m @MontyHarper
- 👀 I’m interested in music, math, science, writing, coding, creativity. In past lives I have been a database designer, children's singer-songwriter, and college algebra teacher. In an alternate time-line I am the author of many middle grade science fiction and fantasy novels.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning iOS Development on Udacity. Hopefully this will become a new career path for me.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... well, I only just learned about GitHub. I'd eventually like to write apps that relate to music, children's education or entertainment, writing, clean energy, science communication... I have lots of ideas and I'm open to discovering new endeavors.
